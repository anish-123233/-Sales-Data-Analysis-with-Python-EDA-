# -Sales-Data-Analysis-with-Python-EDA-
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on sales data using Python. The dataset consists of monthly sales reports, which are merged and analyzed to extract meaningful insights. Key steps include:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Adding new features (e.g., month column, total sales).
3. Identifying sales trends (e.g., best month for sales).
4. Finding frequently bought product pairs using combination analysis.
5. The analysis is conducted using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The results help understand customer purchasing behavior and optimize sales strategies.
